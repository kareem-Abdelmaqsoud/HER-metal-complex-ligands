# HER-metal-complex-ligands

This project focuses on understanding the effect of ligand choice on the performance of a Nickel metal complex in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). This goal to find a correlation between quantum chemistry descriptors and the concentration of hydrogen produced.

$$
\Delta G_{H} = G(\text{Ni--L--H}) - G(\text{Ni--L}) - \tfrac{1}{2} G(\text{H}_{2})
